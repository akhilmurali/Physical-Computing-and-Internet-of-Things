## Computational Unit for IoT hardware

//Image needs to come here:

- Have all modules within a chip improves power efficiency.

### SOC types

#### Edge SoCs

microcontroller class CPU with digital and analog interfaces to sensors and acutuators.

Eg: WSN motes for environmental monitoring, asset tracking, retail beacons.

Applications that need to offer audio/video processing capabilities with entry level machine learning 

wearables, industrial surveillance, robotics, autonomous vehicles, high end wearables and survellaince cameras.

#### Gateway SoCs

Rich nodes that need high levels of data processing, including machine learning.

Connect local devices to the cloud.
Eg: smart home gateway, industrial gateway.

Used for applications that require cpus with wired/wireless connectivity, high speed interfaces like USB, PCIe, SATA etc and sufficient computing through CPUs, DSPs and hardware accelerators.

#### Cloud SOCs

HPC datacenters.

Nordic series

Samsung ARTIK series
- health and wellness systems

Peripheral reflex system
- Allows for communication between units w/o the involvement of CPU. (similar to how the reflex system in body works.)
