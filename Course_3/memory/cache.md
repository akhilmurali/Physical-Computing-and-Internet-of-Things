## Cache

The memory performance is not good enough comparison to that of processor. This creates a latency.

Cache is a low memory hight bandwidth storage.

Key factors of memory that create a bottleneck in performance are 

__Latency__: The time from the issue of a memory request to the time available at the processor.

__Bandwidth__: The rate at which the data can be pumped to the processor by the memory system.

__FLOPS__: Floating point operations.
