# Introduction

Emebedded systems deal with desing of systems that are power and resource constrained.

Usually embedded systems are part of a larger device wherein they perform the tasks of the device.

- Dedicated computer/processor based system built for application/product
- System within a system.

### Charecteristics

- An embedded system is a special-purpose system -the computer is completely encapsulated by the device it controls

- Unlike a general-purpose computer-an embedded system performs one or a few pre-defined tasks-usually with very specific requirements.

- Since the system is dedicated to specific tasks-design engineers can optimize it, reducing the size and cost of the product.

- Single functioned

- Complex Algorithms

-User Interface.

- Tightly Constrained –Power, Cost, Memory

- Reactive and Real-Time.

- Multi-rate.

### Performance Eval of embedded systems

- Response

- Throughput

- Reliability 

– MTBF,MTTR

- Maintainability

- ISP & IAP

- Testability Debug-ability

- Evolvability

- Portability

- Time-to-prototype and Market
