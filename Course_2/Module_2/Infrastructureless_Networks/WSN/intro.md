# Wireless Sensor Networks

WSNs are self configuring and self maintaining networks. 

Enabling technologies for WSN
- Sensor (SMART Sensors)
- Networking 
- Embedded Technologies

WSN collects spatial and temporal data.

__Temporal data__ referes to data that is time-stamped.

WSN provides capability to continuously monitor a space at very high resolution.

### Application of WSN
- Monitor Space
- Monitor Objects
- Monitor Space and Objects

#### Monitoring Space

- Environment or habitat monitoring 
- Precision agriculture
- Indoor climate monitoring
- Indoor security

The size of the geographic are dictates the network architecture, protocol stack and density of nodes deployed in a space.

#### Monitoring Objects

- Structural health monitoring 
- Condition based maintenance
- Medical Diagnostic
- Sniper monitoring form bullet generated acoustic waves.

#### Monitoring Space and Objects
- Wildlife habitats.
- Disaster management.
- Asset tracking
- Health care
- Manufacturing process flow's monitoring

## Energy Techology for WSN

__trivia__: _Batteries store approximately 1 Joule per mm3._

_Fuel cells potentially have 10 times the energy density of bat-teries, considering just the fuel, but the additional volume of the membrane, storage, and housing lowers this by a factor of two tofive. MEMS approaches are exploring micro heat engines and storing energy in rotating micromachinery. Solar panels remain the most common form of energy harvesting, but numerous investigations are exploring avenues for harvesting the mechan4ical energy associated with specific applications, such as flexing shoes, pushing buttons, window vibration, or airflow in ducts_

_With existing technology, a cubicmillimeter of battery space has enough energy to perform roughly 1 billion 32-bit computations, take 100 million sensor samples, or send and receive 10 million bits of data._

Sample battery energy ratings include
- Nonrechargeable lithium: 2,880 J/cm3
- Zinc-air: 3,780 J/cm3(has very high leakage)
- Alkaline: 1,190 J/cm3
- Rechargeable lithium: 1,080 J/cm3
- Nickel metal hydride (NiMHd): 864 J/cm3
- Fuel cells (based on methanol): 8,900 J/cm3
- Hydrocarbon fuels (for use in micro heat engines): 10,500 J/cm3
  
Sample scavenging energy ratings include
- Solar (outdoors midday): 15 mW/cm2
- Solar (indoor office lighting): 10 uW/cm2
- Vibrations (from microwave oven casing): 200 uW/cm3
- Temperature gradient: 15 uW/cm3(from a 10Â°C temperaturegradient)

Joule and Watt relationship:

A Joule is a unit related to energy or work performed on a system. A Watt is a unit of power or the rate which energy is consumed per unit time.

Assuming constant power consumption (the calculus reduced to simple multiplication) we can consider the case of a 100 watt light bulb operated for 1 hour = 3600 seconds

E = (100 J/s)(3600 seconds) = 360 kiloJoules of energy consumed.
