# Infrastructureless Networks (Adhoc Networks)

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a part of the Future Internet paradigm, which rapidly changes the development of technologies as well as provision of services over different communication networks. The capability of end device to identify and communicate with each other at any time‐evolving communication technologies gives the possibility to provide advanced services over global infrastructure (as Internet) in different areas of everyday life .

The interconnection of smart objects and its intero-perability with global communications serve as a main idea incorporated in Internet of Things systems. Wireless sensor network (WSN) plays a main role in the IoT system as its components include sensing, acquiring of data, heterogeneous connectivity, data processing, etc.

Mobile ad‐hoc network (MANET) is a wireless, multi‐hop, self‐configuring network. Its each node operates as an end system and/or a router for other nodes in the network and is closely related to WSNs. The interaction between MANET and Internet of Things opens new ways for provision of services in smart environments and challenging issues in its networking aspects as well.

The following three sections deal with three main categories of infrastrcutureless networks

- Wireless Sensor Networks __(WSN)__
- Mobile Ad hoc Networks __(MANETs)__
- Vehicular Ad hoc Networks __(VANETs)__
